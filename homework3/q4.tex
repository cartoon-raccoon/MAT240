\textbf{Q(4)}
\begin{theorem}
    Let $V$ be a finite dimensional vector space over a field $\F$ and
    $W \sse V$ a supspace. Then $\dim W = \dim V \iff W = V.$
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    Suppose $V = W$. Then $\dim V = \dim W$.

    Now suppose $\dim V = \dim W = n$. Let the set
    $A = \{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\}$ be a basis for $W$.
    Since $A$ is linearly independent in $W$, it is also
    linearly independent in $V$.
    Then since $\dim V = \dim W$, $A$ is also a basis for $V$.

    Since $V$ and $W$ have the same basis, $V = W$.
\end{proof}
